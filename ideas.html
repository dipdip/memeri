							One of the biggest issues with technology today is battery.
                            If all the companies can get together and standardize batteries then maybe we can tackle this issue together.
                            Once all batteries are standardized, we can have solar powered battery/charge stations at every corner.

							How do we get everyone to live comfortably and be successful?
                            Certainly, each person has their own idea of success.  
                            More often than not, their fantasy idea of success is to have everything without ever working for it.
                            <br><br>
                            The lotto is what everyone turns to for their chance at success.  
                            What happens when you win the lotto.  You can buy everything you want.  You don't have to worry about rent.
                            You have a sense of freedom to do whatever you like.  
                            You can pursue your dreams, and if you fail, you can just start all over again without financial worries.
                            <br><br>
                            Clearly there are advantages with being financially independent.  
                            Are the majority of us in such a dire situation that we cannot hope to accomplish anything outside of work?
                            I certainly don't think so.  
                            In today's society, many advances we've made have enabled the majority of us to accomplish the same things 
                            without needing to go through the tedious motions.  
                            What used to require the highest IQ to solve can now be done by simply entering a few numbers into a spreadsheet.  
                            So what does this mean?  
                            I think it means that humans are evolving in a way to enable all of us to accomplish common things without 
                            needing to repeat what many of us have painstakingly done.  So the pioneers have worked hard for a better life for the future.  
                            Does that mean we should just sit back and wait for everything around us to be done?  
                            Perhaps.  I guess then it really comes down to what we are living for.  
                            It would seem that a lot of what our great achievers have enabled us to do is to free up our time for better 
                            understanding of the universe and to a certain extent, allowing us to manage our relationships.  
                            Never before were we able to have so much information at our fingertips.  
                            There is very little physical barriers left between a human being and knowledge.  
                            If you have an idea, you can look it up, and find investors online to back it up.  
                            Yet, only a small fraction of us do anything with this.  We would rather sit and complain about our jobs, 
                            complain about the weather, stress over relationships and wish that we win the lotto.  
                            <br><br>
                            So back to our question.  How do we get everyone to live comfortably and be successful?  
                            Maybe the majority of us already have that freedom, but we focus on the wrong things.

                            <br><br>
                            Why do various nations constantly reproduce even though their life is terrible?
                            Do you really deserve to have kids if you aren't capable of sustaining them comfortably?
                            You went through hardship, yet you don't find it unfair for you to bring yet another child to the suffering in this world?
                            Why are we constantly pouring money into these nations to continue to promote this?  
                            Shouldn't we be buying them contraceptions and let them stop the cycle of suffering?
                            
                            I suppose if neanderthrals throught about it from their children's perspective, we wouldn't be here today and we wouldn't be this far.
                            Selective reproduction, survival of the fittest.  Ensuring that our successors are given the best for their turn.
                            So does that mean those that are wealthy and made it far are the fittest, and that the rest of humanity should be pruned?
                            
                            What about all those that started with relatively humble beginnings, 
                            yet were able to make it farther than those blessed with all the support and tools
                                                        
                            <br><br>
                            -----------------------
                            <br><br>
                            A lot of people have ideas.  Some of us are blessed with the drive to move on our own.
                            Some of us are blessed with family or friends that keeps pushing us.                            
                            Some of us just lack a goal or see the point in accomplishing the task.  And some of us simply want to give a lending hand.
                            Is there a goal building site out there.  A site that helps people identify their initial steps, then slowly helps them build towards their goals.
                            At the same time, the society can give support to pitch into a vision.  And those that pitch in, will also get support.
                            <br><br>
                            I'm sure there should be plenty of such sites in mixed pieces.  
                            However, can we open up large items that affect all of us, like finding a cure to cancer, and have everyone work on it.
                            <br><br>
                            There are plenty of super talented people.  We took various classes and could've excelled in any field.  
                            That siad, in order to make ends meet or to pursue a certain career, our potentials have been made dormant for various tradeoffs.
