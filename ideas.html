                	<b>First idea: </b>
        			<br>            
		            In the realm of Quantum Physics, there is a Law of Attraction which states: "Like attracts like." This means that your vibrations attract similar vibrations. Positive emotions vibrate at a higher level and negative emotions vibrate at a lower level.
					<br>
                    <br>
According to the Law of Attraction, when we are sending out "good vibrations" we are also attracting these same higher level vibrations back to us. For example, when we are happy, we attract more happiness to us. Because of these natural laws of Quantum Physics, we are attracting more good things into our lives to be happy about.
					<br>
                    <br>
On the other hand, when we are sending out "bad vibrations", or the lower level vibrations of the negative emotions, Quantum Physics and the Law of Attraction require that more bad things happen to us. Since like attracts like, we are attracting more bad things into our life to feel bad about.
					<br>
                    <br>
                    So let's test this theory out; set a date and time for millions of people to think of the same positive thing and see what happens!

                    On Dec 1st, 2013, let's all wish for, "a happy smile on everyone!"
