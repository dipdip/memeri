Lisa was a little scared and stayed close to her daddy."

While all the other dogs in the store were excited to see Lisa and her family, the little puppy looked tired and did not even open its eyes."

'Well, I think our family can save this puppy, don’t you ma?' Lisa's Dad smiled.  'I love this dog, but can we afford him?' Lisa’s Mom asked the store owner.  'Listen, with a family like yours, I wouldn’t charge a cent. If you’ll have him, he’s all yours! Just promise to take good care of him.' 'Of course we promise!' Lisa jumped with joy as the family took the puppy home. 'We’ll call him Bobby!'"
